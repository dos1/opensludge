The Secret of Tremendous Corporation consists of two parts:

- a modified SLUDGE engine
- SLG game interpreted by the engine

The game works also with upstream SLUDGE engine (although in versions
2.2.1 and older there can be minor glitches), just missing a few
customisations like "do you want to exit" screen on window close.

Sources of the modified engine:
https://github.com/dos1/opensludge/tree/tsotc-customisation

Sources of the game itself:
https://github.com/TheWalruzz/AdventureTheGame

Only the engine part is changed in customised SLUDGE. All of the       
devkit remains the same, so you can use official devkit to build
the game into SLG file.

Thanks and have fun!
Tremendous Corporation
